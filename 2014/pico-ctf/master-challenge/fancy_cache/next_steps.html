    <h1>Fancy Cache Hint</h1>
    <p>
    Nice job! You've gotten through the hardest part. Now that you can
    read memory, you have everything you need to defeat ASLR. We
    recommend the following high approach to getting a shell. We'll go
    into more detail about each of these below.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use your memory read to figure out the address of the <tt>system</tt> function</li>
      <li>Replace <tt>memcmp</tt>'s GOT entry with system.</li>
      <li>Trigger a call to <tt>memcmp</tt>, and make the first argument a command you want to run :-)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Finding the address of <tt>system</tt></h2>

    <p>
    The ultimate goal of your exploit will be to get the program to call
    <tt>system("some command")</tt>, but in order to do that, have to
    know where in memory <tt>system</tt> is. Since the system has ASLR
    enabled, the location of <tt>system</tt> changes every time you run
    it, so you'll want to leak this information from the program, then
    use it to exploit it in the same connection.
    </p>

    <p>
    So you got the ability to read any memory in the program - how do we
    find <tt>system</tt> given that? To answer this, it helps to
    understand some things how shared libraries work on Linux.
    </p>

    <h3>Shared Libraries on Linux</h3>

    <p>
    First of all, what is a shared library? You have have seen in
    previous problems that a lot of programs call functions like
    <tt>system</tt>, but each program doesn't define its own separate
    version of this function - that would be a lot of redundant code!
    </p>

    <p>
    Instead, we have a single copy of the <tt>system</tt> that all the
    programs on the machine can share, hence a <em>shared</em> library.
    In more detail, every time you run a program, in addition to loading
    the program into memory, Linux also loads a shared library file into
    memory. The libc.so.6 file in the problem description is the shared
    library file for libc, the standard C library. This is the library
    that contains functions such as <tt>printf</tt> and <tt>system</tt>.
    If we can figure out where libc.so.6 is loaded in memory, then we
    can calculate the address of <tt>system</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
    So you may be wondering - if libc.so.6 is loaded at some random
    address, then how does the program know where to look when it wants
    to call a function like <tt>memcmp</tt>?
    </p>

    <p>
    Roughly speaking, the answer is that when the program is initially
    loaded, the code which is doing the loading knows where the
    libraries are loaded and writes the correct addresses into the
    program. Specifically, the code writes the addresses into a table
    calle the Global Offset Table, or GOT. You can see this if you
    disassemble fancy_cache and look at the call to memcmp:
    </p>

    <pre><code>...
8048733: e8 18 fd ff ff        call   8048450 &lt;memcmp@plt&gt;
...</code></pre>

    <p>
    Instead of going straight to the address of memcmp in libc, the call
    goes to 0x8048450, which looks like:
    </p>

    <pre><code>...
08048450 &lt;memcmp@plt&gt;:
 8048450: ff 25 14 b0 04 08     jmp    *0x804b014
 8048456: 68 10 00 00 00        push   $0x10
 804845b: e9 c0 ff ff ff        jmp    8048420 &lt;_init+0x28&gt;
...</code></pre>

    <p>
    0x804b014 is the address of <tt>memcmp</tt>'s entry in the GOT.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is one extra optimization that you should be aware about.
    Above, we said that at program load time, the loader code will fill
    in the correct address of all library functions that the program
    calls, but this isn't quite correct. Looking up the correct
    addresses of all the functions is expensive if there are a lot of
    them, and on any particular run of a program, it might only call a
    subset of the functions that had to be looked up at start time.
    </p>

    <p>
    To avoid this, the loader doesn't actually look up the addresses for
    all of the libray functions at runtime. Instead, it writes the
    address of a function that can be used to do the slow lookup of
    where a libary function is into the program's memory. Initially, the
    GOT entries for each library function points to some code which
    calls this lookup function to find the library function. This
    function also updates the GOT so that future calls to the to library
    function don't need to relookup its location. This optimization is
    called lazy binding. Note how it requires the GOT to be writable.
    This will be useful later :-)
    </p>

    <p>
    The takeaway is that once a library function has been called at
    least once, the GOT will contain the address of the function in the
    library. Once we have the address of one function in the library,
    can subtract an offset (in <tt>memcmp</tt>'s case, 0x142870) to
    figure out where the library starts in memory, and once we know
    where the library starts, we can calculate the address of functions
    inside the library, like <tt>system</tt>!
    </p>

    <h3>Finding where libc.so.6 is loaded</h3>

    <p>
    Try modifying your exploit to leak the value at <tt>memcmp</tt>'s
    GOT entry (0x804b014). You should get back an address ending with
    0x870, and subtracting 0x142870 should tell you where libc.so.6 is
    loaded in memory (we call this the libc base address)
    </p>

    <p>
    Notice now if you run your exploit multiple times, the address you get back
    is different each time - that means the ASLR is working :-)
    </p>

    <h3>Calculating the address of <tt>system</tt></h3>
    <p>
    Now we just need to find the offset of <tt>system</tt> in libc.so.6
    and we can calculate where <tt>system</tt> is in memory. You can get
    this using the <tt>readelf</tt> command:

    <pre>$ readelf -s libc.so.6 | grep system    
...
243: 00119b20    73 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 svcerr_systemerr@@GLIBC_2.0
620: XXXXXXXX    56 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   12 __libc_system@@GLIBC_PRIVATE
...</pre>

   <p>
    The Xed out value is the offset of <tt>system</tt>. Go ahead and add it to
    the libc base address to find the address of system.
   </p>

   <h2>Replace <tt>memcmp</tt>'s GOT entry with system</h2>
   <p>
   Now that you know how the GOT is used, it shouldn't be too surprising
   that overwriting the GOT entry for <tt>memcmp</tt> with the address
   of <tt>system</tt> will cause any calls to <code>memcmp(arg1,
   arg2)</code> to actually do <code>system(arg)</code>.
   </p>
   <p>
   Try modifying your exploit so that you can write arbitrary data to an
   arbitrary address after leaking the libc base. The technique should
   be pretty similar to how you got the read, except with
   <tt>CACHE_SET</tt> instead of <tt>CACHE_GET</tt> :-)
   </p>

   <h2>Trigger a call to <tt>memcmp</tt></h2>
   <p>
   This last part should be pretty easy :-) Make sure to put your shell
   commands in the first argument. Awesome work - enjoy your flag!
